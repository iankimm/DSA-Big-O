1. A. O(1)

B. O(n)

2. O(1); has to go through the function once to figure out either true or false

3. O(n^k); has two nexted loops

4. O(n); has to go through length of array only once

5. O(log(n)); wills top either midway or at the end

6. O(n^k)

7. O(n); it adds number of arrays

8. O(log(n)); might stop in the mid way.

9. O(1); no loops; just goes once

10. O(n); iterates for loop once for the number of n

11. didnt understand the game

it seems like it needs two nested loops to iterate all rods

which can be O(n^k)

12. 

A. O(n)

B. O(1)

C. O(n)

D. O(2^n)

E. O(n)

F. O(n)

G. O(n)
